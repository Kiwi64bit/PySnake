# PySnake

The old retro Snake game that we all love was revived in Python, using Pygame module, with similar aesthetics.

## How to run the game?

To run the script, you have to install the **Pygame** module, specifically, **pygame-ce**.  
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pygame-ce.

```bash
pip install pygame-ce
```

You can run the game eather in an IDE, code editor, or directly from the terminal.  
I suggest you use the terminal as it's way cooler.

Just open the game folder in the terminal and run the next command.
```bash
python main.py
```

See! Easy, right? Did you feel the power of the terminal run throw you? Isn't it great?

## Gameplay

1. Control the snake using WASD or arrow keys.
2. The objective is to fill the screen. 
3. Hitting a wall or yourself will end the game. 
4. The more you eat, the longer your get. 

## Key features

* Modular script: using classes the makes adding more snakes/fruits easy.
* Input buffering: for better movement, and minimum heart attacks.
* Satisfying win screen: that only lasts for 2 seconds.

## What's next?

* A menu screen for starting the game and changing sittings.
* Multiple snake skins.
* Better end screens for both winning and loosing.
* Speed options to control the game difficulty.
* Maybe, just maybe, I will add sprites, as I am trying to keep the original aesthetics.
